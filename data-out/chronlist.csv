Charges of “fraud and corruption” in his campaign were made throughout the spring and summer of 1926, but he won election handily. When his predecessor (William B. McKinley) died in early December 1926, Smith was appointed to fill the vacancy in the term ending March 3, 1927; he presented credentials as a Senator-designate but was not permitted to qualify. He then presented credentials as a Senator-elect to the United States Senate for the term beginning March 4, 1927, but again was not permitted to qualify and subsequently tendered his resignation on February 9, 1928, after the Senate voted that Smith was not entitled to his seat."
